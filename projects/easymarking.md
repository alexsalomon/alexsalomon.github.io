## Introduction
   EasyNarking is an assignment marking application developed for people who have a basic understanding of command line applications and need a software that can help them marking assignments. EasyMarking automatically creates feedback and grade files for each student, compares their assignmentsâ€™ output with the solution, generates class and individual reports and send emails to students with individual feedback and grade information.

## Motivation
   In September, 2011, I accepted a position as a marker for the COMP 2160 (Programming Practices course) at the University of Manitoba. As part of my job, I was asked to mark approximately 500 assignments in a spam of two and a half months. Meanwhile, I was working for FreshBooks full time. I quickly realized that taking 25 minutes to mark each assignment would be bad. That's when I started developping a set of batch scripts that would take care of some of the manual work for me, such as X,Y and Z.

   In January, 2012, I decided to write a python application using SQLite to improve on the functionality provided by the scripts, and to allow any users (other than myself) to use the application. The idea was to distribute the application to future markers at the University of Manitoba.
