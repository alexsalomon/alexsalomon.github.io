## Introduction
   EasyNarking is a command-line assignment marking application developed with the intent to speed up the process of marking student assignments by taking care of all the manual work for you and letting you concentrate in the assignments themselves. EasyMarking creates feedback and grade files for each student, compares their assignmentsâ€™ output with the solution, generates different kinds of course and individual reports and send emails to all the students with individual feedback and grade information. All you have to do is create general feedback sentences once such as "Make sure you indent your code next time", assign an alias and mark value to it, and apply the sentence to any assignments that don't indent their code properly by using the command "fd [alias]".
